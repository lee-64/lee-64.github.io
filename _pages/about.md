I am a second year undergraduate studying [Artificial Intelligence for Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/programs/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-degrees/bs-artificial-intelligence-for-business-buai) at the University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering and Marshall School of Business. At my core, I'm an explorer â€“ of abstract ideas, technologies, and the natural world. This curiosity drives my fascination for deep, technological intricacies and has led me to nearly thirty National Parks (and more in the future!). 

My passion for data science and machine learning in a business context centers around my unwavering, forward-marching commitment towards a better future. **Currently**, I am building projects on topics that:
- I am passionate about, 
- enable me to apply new skills, 
- and offer data-driven, at a glance insights for otherwise convoluted situational constraints

such as my [DJ Recommendation Engine](https://lee-64.github.io/projects/3_project/) and my [Skincare Routine Manager](https://lee-64.github.io/projects/2_project/).
